  Use the `tf-mod-aws-subnets` Terraform module to provision dynamic private/public subnets with NAT instances or gateways.

# External context to include
include:
  - "docs/terraform.md"

# Introduction to this project
introduction: |-
  AWS resources deployed with this project includes:
  - Dynamic subnets based on `var.cidr_block` input and number of Availability Zones in the region. 
      - typically three private & public subnets are created.
  - Deploys a number of private and public route tables as availability zones and associates the dynamically created subnets and appropriate NAT instances/gateways automattically
  - (Recommended) - Deploys a number of NAT gateways based on the number of available zones and creates a route for each respective private subnet to route through to the internet
  - (Optional) - Deploys a number of NAT instances based on the number of available zones and creates a route for each respective private subnet to route through to the internet
